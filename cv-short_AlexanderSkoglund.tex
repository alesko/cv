%\section{\sc Research during Ph.D. studies}
\section{\sc Academic skills}
During my Ph.D. my research field was within imitation learning, where
a robot learns a task by observing a human.  Learning should then
continue to improve the performance by further self-observation or by
providing more knowledge from the demonstrator (teacher). The main
application is to simplify the programming process of an industrial
manipulator (robot arm), a.k.a. ``Programming-by-Demonstration''.

%Within this framework the following research areas are of interest: learning systems,
%human-machine interfaces, human-like motions.
